### Hiya — ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
I have an interest in all things computer science, which as of recently consists of: *search algorithms, raytracing, emulation, webapps, programming languages, static site generators, designing synthesizers, learning new languages, and developing games*.

I’m currently working on way too many projects to count, but feel free to hmu if you want to help or if something doesn't make sense!
