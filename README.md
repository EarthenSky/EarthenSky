### Hiya — ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ

I'm [Gabe](https://gebdev.net), and I'm interested in understanding all things computer science! 

My biggest interests are: 
<ins>search algorithms</ins> ||
<ins>raytracing & 3d reconstruction</ins> ||
<ins>programming languages, program synthesis, & program analysis</ins> ||
<ins>hard problems in math & computer science</ins> ||
<ins>game development & emulation</ins> ||
and finally <ins>audio synthesizers</ins>.

I’m always working on too many small projects, but I'd love to chat about anything somewhat related!
